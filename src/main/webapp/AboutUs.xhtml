					<h2>About Us</h2>
					<br> <br> NB Gardens was formed in 1984 with the aim of
					providing a new lease of life with our gnomes and garden ware. It
					was first established as a home "grown" business but soon blossomed
					into something special. George Gnomer II founded the business in
					Chester. <br> <br> He believed that gnomes lived a secret
					life at night time and came alive under the moonlight to have
					garden parties and water the flowers ensuring they had a healthy
					and prosperous growth. He was a local treasure and soon his stories
					began to spread all over the world. He set up the business as a
					tribute his late wife, Lily, selling quality gnomes that would
					protect peoples gardens. <br> <br> Sadly, when George
					passed away in 2015 it was inherited by his son, Gregory Gnome.
					Gregory decided to add new products to the company in ode to his
					late father and alas; jacuzzis and seeds were stocked at NB
					Gardens. Since the companies birth we have delivered happiness in
					gnome form to millions of happy customers worldwide and delivered
					that extra special something to families around the world.
